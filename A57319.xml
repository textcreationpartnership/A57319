            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Right of the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> to elect Sheriffs in their Common-Hall, proved, from the Cuſtom of our Anceſtors, from their Charters, Hiſtory, Antient Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Judgments and Reſolutions of many Learned Judges.</head>
            <p>IN Changes and Revolutions that have happen'd in this Nation, this Prerogative or Privilege of chuſing Sheriffs has had its Alterations: It was originally in the Freeholders of every County not incorporated, and they choſe this great Officer in their <hi>Folkmote,</hi> which in the Saxon Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is the Court of the Folk or People, which we now call the <hi>County Court.</hi> My Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> from good Authority tells us, That of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Time, <note place="margin">L. C. J. <hi>Cook.</hi> Inſtitut. Part <hi>2.</hi> Fol. <hi>558.</hi>
               </note> ſuch Officers or Miniſters as were inſtituted, either for Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Peace of the County, or for Execution of Juſtice, (becauſe it concerned all the Subjects of that County, and they had as great Intereſt in the juſt and due Exerciſe of their ſeveral Places) were, by force of the King's Writ, in every County choſen, in full or open County, by the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of that County; the Freeholders, as the Repreſentatives of all the People, choſe their She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs: But in Antient Cities, which were Counties incorporated, the Election of their Sheriff was by the Repreſentatives of the Citizens, which were the moſt ſubſtantial Part of the Citizens, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by their Liveries, to which they were called by their ſeveral Companies; which Companies were Corporations, and made By-Laws ſeverally in their ſeveral Halls, and together at their Common-Hall, antiently called their <hi>Hall-mote,</hi> or <hi>Hall-court,</hi> which was and ſtill is, <hi>Conventus Civium in Aulam Publicam.</hi>
               <note place="margin">L.C.J. <hi>Cook</hi>'s Juriſdiction of Courts, F. <hi>249.</hi>
               </note> And this Convention or publick Meeting in <hi>London,</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently called the <hi>Hall-mote,</hi> or the <hi>Folk-mote,</hi> and is at this Day by Preſcription, time out of mind, the Antient <hi>Folk-mote</hi> of <hi>London</hi> for the chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Sheriffs by the Citizens that are of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. This Right and Privilege of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> was taken away by <hi>Will.</hi> 1. called the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror;</hi> who finding the People generally enrag'd for the loſs of their Laws, and had endeavour'd to recover them with their Swords, he pardons thoſe that fought for them, and at <hi>Barkhamſteed</hi> receives from the chief of them new Oaths of Fidelity; and himſelf ſwears before the Arch-biſhop <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franck,</hi> and many of the Nobility, to obſerve the Antient Laws of the Realm, eſtabliſh'd by his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Predeceſſors, Kings of <hi>England;</hi> and eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> among which were thoſe of chuſing Sheriffs.</p>
            <p>This Right and Cuſtom of chuſing Sheriffs was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confirmed and reſtored to the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> by the Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. who thereby kept the Crown, tho the younger Brother; and is not only their Right by Grant, but by Purchaſe too; for they have paid dearly for it when taken away againſt Law and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt had as great need of the Kindneſs of his Subjects, as his Progenitor; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he courted the People in the ſame manner: And in the 28th Year of his Reign, granted in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, by the Statute of <hi>Articuli ſuper Chartas</hi> to the People, that they ſhould have the Election of Sheriffs in every County. My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in his Expoſition of this Statute, ſaith, That though the Words in this Statute be the King's Grant to his People, that they ſhall have the Election of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, which are likewiſe the Words of the Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. yet by the word <hi>Grant,</hi> the People's Right was reſtored, and they by virtue thereof choſe Sheriffs as before the Norman Invaſion, and according to their antient Uſe and Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>That the Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. and the Cuſtom of chuſing Sheriffs in <hi>London,</hi> gave no Right to the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>London</hi> to chuſe Sheriffs otherwiſe than by their Repreſentatives in Common-Hall, is plain from the Words of the Charter of K. <hi>John,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and many other Statutes; for the Words of that Charter are, That the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>London,</hi> and their Heirs, ſhall make Sheriffs among themſelves whom they will, and may amove them when they will; and thoſe whom they make, ſhall preſent to the Juſtices of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> of thoſe things which to the ſaid Sheriffwick appertains, whereof they ought to anſwer us.</p>
            <p>To remove Sheriffs muſt be by ſome Court, that muſt, in behalf of the People, call the Sheriffs to an Accompt, and that muſt be by a Court that by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Preſcription have Cognizance of the Faults and Miſdemeanours done by thoſe great Officers, for which they amove them: and that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Work of a Court, it cannot be by all the People of the whole County incorporated, but is the Work of a <hi>Hall-mote</hi> or <hi>Hall-court,</hi> intruſted by all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to chuſe for them and the King, honeſt and able Men for Sheriffs, and to preſent them to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> as they do in their Liveries to this Day, and have ſo done time out of mind. For the Right of this <hi>Common-hall,</hi> or <hi>Hall-mote,</hi> to elect Sheriffs, there cannot be a better Proof than the By-Law of the 23 <hi>Septemb.</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi> and 15<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. which if conſider'd, cannot be imagin'd to be By-Laws of the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> but of the <hi>Common-Hall;</hi> for the By-Law of 7 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. enacts, That the Election of Mayors and Sheriffs ſhall be only by the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> the Maſter and Wardens of every Myſtery of the City coming in their Liveries, and by other honeſt Men for that purpoſe ſpecially ſummoned. What is hereby enacted more, than that the Maſter and Wardens of every Myſtery ſhall elect in their Gowns? If the <hi>Common Council</hi> were there, it is an Act of the <hi>Commonalty,</hi> not of the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> who had nothing to do with the Matter. But if this were the Act of the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> called the <hi>Commonalty,</hi> (as it plainly appears to be) who have Power to make By-Laws in that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it is a good By-Law to diſtinguiſh the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the Citizens for chuſing Mayors and Sheriffs from others.</p>
            <p>The By-Law of 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. enacts, That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Wardens of the Myſteries of the City, in their Halls, or other Places of the City fit and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, aſſociating to them the honeſt Men of their Myſteries, being clothed in their laſt Livery, ſhall go together to the <hi>Guildhall</hi> of the City for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in their laſt Livery but one, to the Election of the Sheriffs of the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that no others beſides the honeſt Men of the <hi>Common-Council</hi> of the City, ſhall be preſent at the ſaid Elections. Now I am very confident, that the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98307:2"/>Recorder himſelf will not, under his Hand, publiſh this to be an Act of the <hi>Common-Council;</hi> for 'tis not credible that the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> who are ſaid to make Laws by Advice of their Recorder, and others learned in the Law, ſhould make a Law, that no others beſides the honeſt Men of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council</hi> of the City ſhould be preſent at ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, for that were to repeal the Charters of the City, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all other Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Confirming, Granting, and Reſtoring the Liberties and Privileges of the Citizens, in which they have an Inheritance. For as the Lords and Commons, in Writs of Summons to Parliament, are call'd the <hi>Common-Council</hi> of the Kingdom, and are to adviſe in Matters of Weight and Difficulty; ſo is the <hi>Common-Hall</hi> the extraordinary <hi>Common-Council</hi> of all the Citizens of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two Laws therefore cannot be Acts of <hi>Common-Council;</hi> they muſt be Acts of <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> or <hi>Hall-Court,</hi> which to this Purpoſe are a <hi>Common-Council,</hi> or a Council of the Commons, and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this Act a <hi>Common-Council,</hi> in the other the <hi>Commonalty</hi> who were in Council aſſembled, as the Repreſentatives of the Commons, to make By-Laws for them, and call themſelves ſometimes the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council of the City,</hi> as they properly are in this Matter; ſometimes the <hi>Commonalty,</hi> as the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the People in Parliament are called, and do call themſelves in all Acts of Parliament, the <hi>Commons,</hi> who are but the Repreſentatives of the <hi>Commons;</hi> and are alſo called, in the Antient Oaths of Coronation eſtabliſhed by Parliament, the <hi>Vulgi,</hi> or <hi>Common People,</hi> tho but their Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>The Uſe and Cuſtom of chuſing Sheriffs, makes this beyond Contradiction; for at this very Day the Maſters and Wardens of the Myſteries in the City in their Halls, clothed as aforeſaid, go to the Elections of Mayors and Sheriffs, to the <hi>Guildhall,</hi> and there do elect, not as Men of the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> but as a <hi>Hall-mote,</hi> or <hi>Hall-court;</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> that are not of the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as a <hi>Hall-mote,</hi> or <hi>Hall-court,</hi> not as a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Peace and Quiet of the City, it were to be wiſh'd that thoſe Acts of <hi>Common-Council</hi> (as they are ſaid to be) had never been printed; they have given juſt cauſe to Men to believe, That there are thoſe that againſt Law and Reaſon, againſt Practice and Cuſtom, would take from the Citizens the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Mayors and Sheriffs, by their Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in <hi>Common-Hall.</hi> They have laid a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nay they have been ſcaffolding many Years, by their Acts and Devices; and have had the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to diſturb and make void Elections by the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> and have taken away the Rights and Liberties of the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> on purpoſe to take Fines, and then to compel the <hi>Common-Hall</hi> to new Elections, a thing not known to our Anceſtors. This is not only levying Money at other Times, and in other manner than by Act of Parliament, as was done by the late K. <hi>James,</hi> and is numbred among the Grievances of the Statute of 1 K. <hi>Will.</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> but is raiſing Money without any colour of Law, and yet vindicated in the vileſt manner; for Men are publickly forbid to ſpeak of, or mention this Grievance, becauſe the King is beyond-Sea; when in truth a greater Service cannot be to the King, than to prevent theſe Extravagancies which are againſt his Coronation-Oath, by which he has promis'd to govern according to the Statutes in Parliament agreed on, and the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England.</hi> The late K. <hi>James</hi> (as it is declared in the firſt of K. <hi>Will.</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary</hi>) by Miniſters em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by him, did endeavour to ſubvert the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, Laws for free Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: As that of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 1ſt is endeavoured to be ſubverted by the <hi>Common-Council:</hi> The Words of the Statute are, For that Elections ought to be free, The King commands, upon great Forfeiture, That no great Man, nor other, by Force, Malice or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, ſhall diſturb free Elections. And my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> in his Expoſition of that Statute, tells us, there were two Miſchiefs before the making this Statute. 1. Elections were not duly made. 2. Elections were not freely made: And both theſe were againſt the antient Maxim of the Law, <hi>Fiant Electiones rite &amp; libere, ſine interruptione aliqua:</hi> For before this Act, in the irregular Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 3. the Electors had neither their free nor their due Elections; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Force, ſometimes by Menaces, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Malice, the Electors were framed and wrought to make election of Men unworthy, or not eligible, ſo as their Election was neither due nor free. This Act briefly rehearſeth the old Rule of the Common Law, (that Elections ought to be free) wherein both the ſaid Points are included: 1. It muſt be a due Election; and, 2. It muſt be a free Election.</p>
            <p>This Statute doth enact, That no Man, upon grievous Forfeiture, ſhall diſturb any to make free Elections; and is excellently penned in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: Firſt, For that generally it extendeth to all Elections, that is to ſay, to every Dignity, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or Place elective, be it Eccleſiaſtical or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, of what Kind or Quality ſoever. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Act is penned in the Name of the King, <hi>viz.</hi> The King commandeth: And therefore the King bindeth himſelf not to diſturb any Electors to make free Election, as in the like Caſe upon a Statute made in the Reign of the ſaid King; The Act ſaying, <hi>Rex perpendens, &amp;c.</hi> the ſame bound the King. Now that Electors might make free and due Elections, without diſpleaſure or fear thereof, by this Act of Parliament, as a ſure Defence, the King commandeth the ſame upon grievous Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And this Act extends to all Elections, as well by thoſe that at the making this Act, had Power to make them, as by thoſe whoſe Power was raiſed or created ſince this Act.</p>
            <p>The Diſturbers of free Elections, he ſays, are to be puniſhed with grievous Fines, and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Yet how notoriouſly was this moſt excellent Law violated by the very Government of the City of <hi>London,</hi> at the laſt Election of Sheriffs? What ill and dangerous Example was given to the whole Nation by the Magiſtrates of the City of <hi>London</hi> at that Election? What open and publick Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to affront and contemn his Majeſty's Laws made to prevent Diſorders and Tumults? What popular Confuſion might have hapned from thoſe whoſe Rights and Liberties were invaded againſt Law and Juſtice; by the Sheriffs denying the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that was deſired to be put, Whether to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, or proceed to a new Election, when humbly intreated.

            <p>Upon a Reference by the King's Privy Council to Sir <hi>John Forteſcue,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Priſcot,</hi> Chief Juſtices, and to the reſt of the Juſtices, concerning a Sheriff conſtituted by the King himſelf, it is thus in the Council-Book recorded, 3 <hi>Martii, ann.</hi> 34. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. as followeth, in theſe Words:</p>
            <p>Upon a Demand that my Lord Chancellor made to the Chief Judges, and to the Remnant of the Judges, how that the King's Laws, neither Juſtice, might not be executed in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> becauſe there was no Sheriff there, and that the King by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents under his great Seal, had deputed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Men for to have be Sheriffs there, what them ſeemed ſhould be done in this Behalf? ſo that the King's Laws and Juſtice might been executed in that Shire, as executed in other Shires in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 2 Chief Juſtices the ſame Day came unto my Lords of the King's Council in the Sterred-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and upon the above ſaid Demand ſaid, that them ſeemed, and ſo it ſeemed unto the Remnant of the Judges, that the King did an Error, when that he made another Perſon Sheriff of <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> than was choſen, and preſented unto his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, after the Effect of the Statute in ſuch Behalf made.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> II. this was a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy between the King and the People, who under the Conduct of the Barons came to <hi>London,</hi> where it was ended by the Submiſſion of that unfortunate Prince; and one of the Articles of Deprivation againſt him was, that he diſplaced divers Sheriffs lawfully elected, and put in their Places ill Men, thereby ſubverting the Law, contrary to his Oath and Honour. The Common-Council of <hi>London,</hi> as Freemen, have ſworn to maintain the Franchiſes and Liberties of the City, yet they are the very Men that make By-Laws to take away this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Franchiſe, which is a Truſt lodg'd in the Common-Hall by many Kings and Parliaments.</p>
            <p>The Power that a Common-Council-man has is as one of the Livery, he cannot elect unleſs of the Livery; all that are not ſo are commanded to withdraw by the Crier, before the Election, on pain of Impriſonment; yet when he is elected, he (as is pretended) has a Power in Common-Council to disfranchiſe his Corporation.</p>
            <p>'Tis adjudged in <hi>Cook</hi>'s 5th <hi>Rep.</hi> the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain of <hi>London</hi>'s Caſe, that the Common-Council of <hi>London</hi> cannot make Laws againſt the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, and that ſuch Laws made by them are void: But Laws made by them, or other Aſſemblies of Men that are not repugnant to Law and Reaſon, are good: 'Tis there reſolved, that Laws made by them <hi>pro privato lucro</hi> are vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d: 'Tis there adjudged, that they may make Laws for good Order and Government; the Government there intended is the Government by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by Parliament, not a Government by Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers choſe by them contrary to Charters and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes; ſuch Laws are made againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City, and are void.</p>
            <p>'Twas reſolved by all the Judges in <hi>England,</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Dungannon</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that only Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are capable to take ſuch Inheritances. A Common-Council, it ſeems, can give what it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take, for a Common-Council is no Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Trin.</hi> 32 <hi>Eliz.</hi> In an Action of falſe Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment in the Common Pleas, brought by <hi>Clarke</hi> againſt <hi>Gape,</hi> the Defendant juſtified the Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. had incorporated St. <hi>Albans</hi> by the Name of Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them to make Ordinances, and ſhews that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> appointed the Term to be held there, by reaſon of which they, with the Conſent of the Plaintiff and other Burgeſſes, aſſeſſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Inhabitant towards the erecting Courts there, and ordained, that if any refuſed Paiment, he ſhould be impriſoned; and for that the Plaintiff being a Burgeſs refuſed Paiment, he as Mayor juſtified; and this was adjudged no Plea, for that this by-Law is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98307:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>againſt <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Conſent of the Plaintiff could not alter the Law.</p>
            <p>If a Common-Council may take away this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Franchiſe of chooſing Sheriffs, why may they not take away their Liberty and Franchiſe of uſing Trades in the City? The Law has ſecured the one as much as the other; and the doing the latter ſucceeded very ill with a Mayor and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen of <hi>London</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Juſtice <hi>Crooke</hi> in the firſt part of his Reports, <hi>fol.</hi> 33. ſaith, That <hi>Periam</hi> Juſtice ſaid, he had ſeen a Precedent in the time of K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. where a Citizen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſued a Citizen of <hi>London</hi> in the Common Bench, and the Mayor and Aldermen would have him put the Matter to Compromiſe, which he refuſed; whereupon they did disfranchiſe him, and he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Matter to the Court, and thereupon they directed their Writ to the Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to reſtore him to his Franchiſe, and they aſſeſſed a Fine of an hundred Marks upon every of them that were Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Disfranchiſement, which they payed, as appeareth by the Record, and the Citizen was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his Franchiſe.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion ask'd the Judges in the 40th and 41ſt of <hi>Eliz.</hi> was, Whether the antient and uſual Elections of the Mayors, Bayliffs, Provoſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by a certain ſelect Number of the Principal of the Commonalty, or of the Burgeſſes, commonly called the Common Council, or by ſuch other Name, and not in general by all the Commonalty or Burgeſſes, nor by ſo many of them as would come to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, were good in Law? Foraſmuch as by the Words of the Charters the Election ſhall be indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely by the Commonalty, or by the Burgeſſes, which is as much as to ſay, by all the Commonalty, or all the Burgeſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which all thoſe learned Judges gave this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That antient and uſual Elections of Officers of Corporations, by a certain ſelect Number of the Principal of the Commonalty by Preſcription, and not by all the Commonalty in general, were good Elections, and well warranted by their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and By-Laws alſo. This Reſolution of the Judges juſtifies the Cuſtom, Uſage and Practice of the Common-Hall to a tittle. Had they conſidered this very Caſe, and heard Arguments on both ſides, and decided the Matter for the Common-Hall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Common-Council, they could not have adjudged more plainly and fully, for the manner of electing Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> by the Common-Hall.</p>
            <p>Acts of Common-Council had no Authority to order or regulate Elections, unleſs confirmed by Common-Hall, before the Prerogatives of Lord Mayors was ſet on Horſe-back, and the Liberties of the City trodden under foot: An Evil as old as <hi>Solomon;</hi> for antiently ſuch By-Laws were confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Common-Hall, as appears in their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Books and Memorials in their <hi>Guildhall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 18th <hi>Edw.</hi> II. one <hi>John Cauſton</hi> had been choſen Sheriff at the uſual time: he not appearing upon a Proclamation, the Aldermen and Commons were ſummoned to be at <hi>Guildhall</hi> the <hi>Michaelmas-</hi>Day next following; on which Day <hi>Cauſton</hi> was disfranchiſed and put out of his Aldermanſhip: But the Common-Hall did not confine themſelves to this only; they made Ordinances in their <hi>Guild-hall</hi> concerning the electing Common-Council-men in the ſeveral Wards, as appears by their antient Books, in the Reigns of <hi>Edw.</hi> III. and <hi>Rich.</hi> II.</p>
            <p>Theſe antient Charters, Rights, Cuſtoms and Preſcriptions of the City of <hi>London</hi> have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and confirmed to the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> in all Ages. The City of <hi>London</hi> is <hi>Cor Regni,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its Charters, its antient Liberties and Cuſtoms were not only granted and ſold to them by Kings, but the Purchaſe confirmed by many Parliaments: <hi>Civitas Londin, habeat omnes libertates ſuas antiquas,</hi> are the Words of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſays hath been antiently thus expounded, Let the City of <hi>London</hi> have their Franchiſes to which they are inheritable by lawful Title, by the Gift and Confirmations of Kings, which they have not abuſed and forfeited, and which are not repugnant to Law.</p>
            <p>The Statute of 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. ſays, The City of <hi>London</hi> ſhall have all their Franchiſes. The Statute <hi>de Tallagio non concedendo</hi> ordains, that all Clerks and Laymen of <hi>England</hi> ſhall have their Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and free Cuſtoms, as largely and wholly as they have uſed to have them when they had them beſt; and that all Statutes made, and Cuſtoms brought in, contrary to them, ſhall be fruſtrate and void for evermore.</p>
            <p>The Statute of this preſent King and the late Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> reſtores to the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens, all their Rights, Gifts, Charters, Grants, Liberties, Privileges, Cuſtoms, Uſages, Conſtitutions and Preſcriptions, and all to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: The two Acts of Common-Council of the 7th and 15th <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. like the two mighty Idols <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> devour all our Charters, Rights, Liberties, Cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all thoſe Statutes that give and reſtore them: <hi>Quid juvant Statuta?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pride and Ambition is the Cauſe of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; they contend for Prerogatives, which makes Men mad, and they catch at Shadows, and beat and wound themſelves with their own Weapons.</p>
            <p>I cannot forget that old Expoſition of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which ſays, the Citizens ſhall have their Franchiſes to which they are inheritable; that good old Gentleman is unmannerly, for we are now told he ſhould have ſaid, If the Common-Council pleaſe.</p>
            <p>I, for my part, bemoan the Condition of poor Mr. <hi>Wills;</hi> for notwithſtanding the Advice of ſome of the Judges, as is pretended, yet if the preſent Caſe of the Common-Hall, lately printed, be true, and they be ſworn that be not elected, that poor Gentleman ſtands in need of the Prayers of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. The Conſequence of this idle Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy muſt be ſad and fatal to him, and all that ſhall fall under that Calamity. How ſhall ſuch Men act that are no Officers? Men not duly elected have no Authority, they are in Danger of Suits, they can neither be Officers nor Judges: Here are greater Difficulties like to be than when the 2 Chief Juſtices, Sir <hi>John Forteſcue</hi> and Sir <hi>John Priſcott,</hi> were adviſed with by his then Majeſty's Privy Council. The City will bewail this Confuſion and Diſorder: This Calamity will be far greater than that of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and greater Miſchiefs will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue than are foreſeen, which they muſt anſwer for that are the Occaſion of theſe undue Elections. But for that poor Gentleman, I ſay, God ſend him a good Deliverance.</p>
